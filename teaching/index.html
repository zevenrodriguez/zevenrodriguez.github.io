            This lecture-based course will provide you with hands-on experience using a variety of digital communications technologies. Topics covered include Web design, image editing, animation, and a variety of multimedia tools. Principles of design, media theory,
            and history will also be addressed in class discussion.
            </br>
            In addition to coding with HTML and CSS, we'll be using software applications including Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator for in-class demonstrations and assignments. While not the only tools of their kind, they are a good place to start. These applications
            are available through Adobe Creative Cloud.

            In this course students will spend the semester designing and building a prototype. We will explore the design process from the ideation phase to prototype and creation. The class is broken up to 3 sections: 3D Design and Production, Electronics, and
            PCB design. In the 3D Design section, students will be introduced to fabrication and modeling using SketchUp and Illustrator. They will fabricate their designs using laser cutters and 3D Printers. In the next section, we will be using Arduino
            microcontroller to add interaction to our prototypes. Finally, we will transfer our circuits from our breadboard to a PCB. We will use the EagleCAM software to design our board, which we will then get printed. At the end of the semester students
            will have produce a full working prototype with an enclosure, functioning electronics, and assembled PCB board.

            The focus of this course is to explore how we interact between the digital and physical world. In this class you will be introduced to the Arduino microcontroller as well as screen based languages like python and max/msp. We will learn about how interaction
            design effects the products and installations, we engage with on a daily basis. By using different switches, sensors, and screen based interactions we will discover best practices in usability and interaction. Students will work on creative
            group projects and provide on-line documentation of their work.

            Advanced web design is a continuation of ADV2450 Web I, a prerequisite of this course. Students will study, in further detail, HTML and CSS to ensure that they have a solid foundation. It is assumed that students have a solid grasp of Photoshop and Illustrator,
            and understand the proper web design workflow. The course is focused on completing a web site, designing and building it, as well as writing all the content for the site. A portfolio site is not appropriate for the final project, and will
            not be acceptable. Search Engine Optimization, Analytics, and web marketing strategies will be reviewed, and implemented.

            The goal of this course is to let students experiment and create electronic circuits and 3D prints. The class is divided into two main topics: Electronics and 3D Printing. Each topic while have several modules. After each module students will have created
            a circuit, model, or 3D print. Students will be introduced how to create physical interfaces by learning how to program the Arduino micro controller. They will learn how to use sensors to translate physical interaction to output a sensory
            experience. Finally, they will design and print 3D models. Students will learn basic fabrication, modeling techniques, and processes used in 3D printing. Then they will learn how to create models using 123D Design and learn how to print them.
