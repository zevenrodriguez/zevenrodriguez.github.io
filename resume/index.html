          <h3>CIM540-640 - Intro to Creative Coding </h3>
          <p>This course will introduce students to the building blocks of creative coding within the visual and media environment. Students will learn to create dynamic images, type and interfaces, that can translate into web, mobile and print forms. Through sets of problems, students will learn programming fundamentals that translate in virtually all programming platforms.</p>

          <h3>CIM542-642 - Physical Computing</h3>
          <p>This course explores how to build a bridge between the physical and digital world. Students will learn to develop software and hardware to sense and respond to physical interaction. Through various projects, students will learn how to program sensors and other electronic components to convert the human senses into creative inputs and outputs, such as lights, sounds, and movement. Students will learn the ideation and design process through challenges presented in their assignments and personal projects. In this course students will also learn how to design for and use various digital fabrication tools, such as 3D printing, laser and paper cutting, and CNC milling. Students will have access to work hands on with these fabrication tools to enhance and build their prototypes.</p>

            <h3>Introduction to Web Design and Computer Principles</h3>
            <p>This lecture-based course will provide you with hands-on experience using a variety of digital communications technologies. Topics covered include Web design, image editing, animation, and a variety of multimedia tools. Principles of design, media theory, and history will also be addressed in class discussion.
            </br>
              In addition to coding with HTML and CSS, we'll be using software applications including Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator for in-class demonstrations and assignments. While not the only tools of their kind, they are a good place to start. These applications are available through Adobe Creative Cloud.</p>

            <h5><b>CUNY College of Technology</b></h5>
            <h3>Tangible Media Skills</h3>
            <p>In this course students will spend the semester designing and building a prototype. We will explore the design process from the ideation phase to prototype and creation. The class is broken up to 3 sections: 3D Design and Production, Electronics, and PCB design. In the 3D Design section, students will be introduced to fabrication and modeling using SketchUp and Illustrator. They will fabricate their designs using laser cutters and 3D Printers. In the next section, we will be using Arduino microcontroller to add interaction to our prototypes. Finally, we will transfer our circuits from our breadboard to a PCB. We will use the EagleCAM software to design our board, which we will then get printed. At the end of the semester students will have produce a full working prototype with an enclosure, functioning electronics, and assembled PCB board.</p>

            <h3>Ins/Outs of Physical Computing</h3>
            <p>The focus of this course is to explore how we interact between the digital and physical world. In this class you will be introduced to the Arduino microcontroller as well as screen based languages like python and max/msp. We will learn about how interaction design effects the products and installations, we engage with on a daily basis. By using different switches, sensors, and screen based interactions we will discover best practices in usability and interaction. Students will work on creative group projects and provide on-line documentation of their work.</p>
